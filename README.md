On-the-fly evaluation/substitution of emacs lisp code

Inspired by Light Table similar feature.

Not ment to be used in production yet, be warned!

In action

1. Presentation of the basic *prototype*: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgHvRcbYJ-8 [2:32] \(you don't have to watch this\)
2. New features, less slow awkward typing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNO-vgq3Avg [1:50]

Contribute
=======

* If you feel like contributing, there are **TODO** annotations in the code. Mostly basic/trivial stuff, good exercise for people starting with elisp.
* If you have more substantial ideas, start an issue so we can discuss it. I'm open to all ideas, this is simply a precaution for people to not work on the same feature.
* If you want, you can [throw a couple bucks my way](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=CEYP5YVHDRX8C) \(we have a long way to beat that $300k goal people!\).
