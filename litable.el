;;; Commentary:

;; This allows light-table like dynamic evaluation with Emacs. It's
;; fun for investigating lisp or for particular light problems before
;; you delve in and start hacking serious functions together.

;; It's very much a work in progress, please heed that warning.

;;; Code:

(require 'dash)
(require 'thingatpt)

;;;;; global TODO
;; 1. investigate: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-emacs-sources/2009-04/msg00032.html
;;    and merge relevant parts.
;;
;; 2. update free variable bindings when `setq' call is made on them.
